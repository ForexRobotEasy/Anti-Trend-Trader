## How It Works

**Anti Trend Trader** works by monitoring and analyzing market trends to identify potential trading opportunities. It follows an anti-trend strategy, which means it looks for situations where the market is likely to reverse its current trend.

The robot starts by checking if the current equity is above the minimum deposit requirement. If the equity is below the minimum deposit, it prints a message stating that there is insufficient equity to start trading.

If the equity meets the minimum deposit requirement, the robot proceeds to check for potential trading opportunities based on market trends. This is done by calling the `CheckMarketTrends()` function.

The `CheckMarketTrends()` function is where you can add your own logic to monitor and analyze market trends. If a trading opportunity is identified, the function should return `true`. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

If a trading opportunity is identified, the robot executes the trade by calling the `ExecuteTrade()` function.

In the `ExecuteTrade()` function, the position size is calculated based on the equity volume. The stop loss and take profit levels are then placed for the trade using the `OrderSend()` function. If the order placement is successful, the robot prints a message stating that the trade was executed successfully.

The robot continues to monitor and manage the trade to maximize profits. Any necessary cleanup or finalization code can be added in the `OnDeinit()` function.
